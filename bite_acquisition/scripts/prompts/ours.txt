You are feeding me a plate of food.
Items remaining: %s
Portions remaining (corresponding to items remaining list): %s 
Efficiency: %s
Preference: %s
Dipping sauces remaining: %s

Given this information, you will decide what bite to feed me next. You may ONLY suggest a bite from the available 'Items remaining', optionally dipped in an item from 'Dipping sauces.'
1) First, summarize what food items are remaining on the plate with corresponding portions. Make sure that your summarization matches with the 'Items remaining' and 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning.
2) Next, summarize your high-level strategy for feeding me. Describe the order of bites you would use to feed me the remaining items, and explain how you make your decision. Note that bites taken so far do not affect items remaining. 
   Decision Criteria:
    - Prioritize my preference above all else. If I have a strong preference for a particular ordering of foods, you should obey that as best as possible. Respect user preferences for not dipping certain food items in certain sauces. If the preference specifies 'Feed me X and then Y', perceive it as me asking you to feed all of X before you feed any of Y.
    - "Alternating between X and Y" means you can start with either X or Y, unless otherwise specified. If one item is more efficient, start with that.
    - In the past, I have eaten the following bites: %s. The first item of this list is the first bite I had, the second item is the second bite, and so on. The last element is the most recent bite that I just had. Use this to inform what you feed me next. Note that bites taken so far are past bites and thus do not affect the specified items or portions remaining on the plate.
    - In your answer, state the portions of each item remaining. Ensure that this matches with the 'Portions remaining' provided at the beginning. Note that these items haven't been consumed. If I do not have a strong preference, use commonsense. For dishes like noodles with vegetables and meat, or porridge with different toppings, prioritize feeding me a MIX of different items. This means do not feed me the same item consecutively twice if it doesn't affect efficiency. The exception to this rule is if there is a lot more of one item than another. In that case, you should prioritize feeding me the item with more quantity, until the portions of items left are more evenly distributed, even if I have eaten the larger portion item consecutively. If only a single portion of an item is left, do not feed it but leave it until later for better bite variety (unless the preference instructs otherwise). Lastly, use your best judgment to figure out what ordering makes sense. For instance, looking at a plate of carrots, ranch, canteloupe, apples, and caramel, you should be able to tell that apples go with the caramel, and carrots go with the ranch, and that apple should not be dipped in ranch because that is not typical, and canteloupe and other melon types should be eaten plain. Avoid feeding savory foods with sweet sauces, and vice versa (i.e. chicken nugget and chocolate sauce is NOT a good suggestion, apple should not be dipped in ketchup; canteloupe, honeydew, and melons are usually eaten plain without sauce). A good rule of thumb is to prioritize: common pairings (i.e. sweet savory), portion sizes, and bite variability (in that order).
3) Next, choose an item from 'Items available' to feed next, based on your answer to 2). Examples: "Feed shrimp", "Feed apple dipped in caramel", "Do not feed a bite". You can either feed a single food item which appears in 'Items remaining' ("Feed shrimp"), a single food item dipped in something ("Feed apple dipped in caramel"), or opt to not feed an item ("Do not feed a bite"); only do this if I strongly dislike the remaining bites, or I only requested a 2 bites of 'tiramisu,' for example, at the end of a meal, and you already fed me both (as mentioned in 'The bites I have taken so far'). You CANNOT feed a dip (i.e. ranch, mustard, whipped cream, bbq sauce, chocolate sauce, etc.) by itself. You can ONLY feed an item if it is present in 'Items remaining.' For example, given 'Items remaining: ["broccoli", "asparagus"]', you cannot suggest "Feed pasta", even if I have taken a bite of 'pasta' in the past.
4) Now, consider efficiency; in the numbers listed above, higher means that food item is more efficient to pick up. Would you change your answer to 3) given this information? If the portions are even (difference of <3 bites), and my preference is weak or alternating, and one item is clearly more efficient, you may change your answer. Otherwise, do not change your answer.
5) Now, summarize your planned bite from 4) in a list format. You can either output a single item in a list ['item'], where 'item' is chosen from 'Items remaining', if you would like to feed this item by itself. Or, you can output two items in a list ['item1', 'item2'], if you would like to dip 'item1' (from 'Items remaining') in 'item2' (from 'Dipping sauces remaining') i.e. ['banana', 'nutella']. However, you cannot suggest to feed 2 items if one of them is not a dip (i.e. ['ramen', 'beef'] or ['rice', 'chicken'] or ['linguini', 'mushroom'] are NOT allowed, you must feed ['ramen'] or ['beef'] by itself). Lastly, you can output an empty list [] if there is absolutely no bite that makes sense.

Food Items Left: <Sentence describing what food items are left on the plate; ensure that this matches with the 'Items remaining' provided at the beginning>
Strategy: <Sentence describing your high-level strategy>
Next bite: <Phrase describing the next bite you plan to feed>
Next bite (accounting for efficiency): <Phrase describing the next bite you plan to feed, taking into account efficiency>
